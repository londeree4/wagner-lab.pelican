### Person Perception
Research in the lab focuses on the cognitive and neural representation of other peopleâ€™s personality and mental states. This work is aimed at understanding how our knowledge of other people (their likes and dislikes, their personalities, their quirks and habits) is organized into a coherent impression and, in turn, how this impression is encoded in the brain. Using a combination of functional neuroimaging, machine learning techniques and popular media (e.g., films, television), we are working towards developing methods to gain access to how individuals think and feel about the people around them.

### Self Regulation Failure
A separate line of research consists in understanding the interplay between motivation, self-control and desire in order to identify neural and behavioral predictors of self-regulation failure as well as to identify ways to bolster against everyday temptations.
