### The Wagner Social Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory

The Wagner Lab is located in the Department of Psychology at The Ohio State University. Research in the Wagner Lab is primarily focused on investigating how humans take disparate facts and observations about other persons and weave these into the complex and multidimensional character portraits that form the basis of our person knowledge. 

Research in the Wagner Lab is also focused on examining the behavioral and neural mechanisms of self-regulation and its failure. In particular, we are interested in how people's subjective perceptions of the reward value of temptations is related to individual differences and situational contexts. 

Research in the lab combines behavioral and brain imaging approaches with an emphesis on _reasonably naturalistic_ stimuli and contexts (e.g., movies, stories, natural scenes) to examine the relationship between social perception, self-regulation and the brain.
